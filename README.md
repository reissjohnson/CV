## Reiss Johnson 

- I am a young professional with a passion for technology & adventure.
- I am 22 years old & based in Manchester. My background is in photography & media, however in autumn of 2015, I decided to learn to code, as I wanted to be part of an industry that is ever-expanding & be able to secure a future for myself.
- I love to help others to learn as well as learn myself, and by gaining my first role as a junior developer. I hope to further my existing knowledge.

## Skills

#### Web Development

I recently finished the Ronin program. A 16 week intense & fulltime web-dev bootcamp designed by Makers Academy. I learned the value of TDD, BDD, OOD, XP, working in an agile way, everyday was spent pair-programming constantly building my skills. 

Below are just a handful of some of the projects I worked on, most are in an unfinished state & now the course has ended my aim is to refactor & get these as finished as possible.
