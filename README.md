## Reiss Johnson 

I am a young professional with a passion for technology & adventure.
22 years old, Manchester. I got my first computer aged 6 and it went from there, my background is in photography & media however in autumn of 2015 I decided to learn to code. I love to help others to learn as well as learn myself, and by gaining my first role as a junior developer I hope to further my existing knowledge.

## Skills

#### Web Development

I recently finished the Ronin program; a 16 week intense & fulltime web-dev bootcamp designed by Makers Academy. I learned the value of TDD, BDD, OOD, XP. I learnt how to work in an agile way, everyday was spent pair-programming mainly with Ruby but also with some Javascript frameworks.

Below are just a handful of some of the projects I worked on, now the course has ended my aim is to refactor & get these as finished as possible.
